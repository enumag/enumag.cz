title: "Arachne/Verifier - Request Validator for Nette/Application"
perex: |
    The concept behind <a href="https://github.com/Arachne/Verifier">Arachne/Verifier</a> was originally meant to solve annotations-based authorization for <a href="https://github.com/nette/application">Nette/Application</a>.
    Now after years of development it is no longer limited to neither annotations nor authorization making it a very powerful tool for your security layer.
