    Ever wanted to get rid of <code>EntityManager::find($id)</code> as the first thing in your every presenter action?
    With <a href="https://github.com/Arachne/EntityLoader">Arachne/EntityLoader</a> you can.
    Of course it is not limited to Doctrine, you can easily use it with a different ORM library.
